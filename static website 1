    <h1> I want to make a site similar to the scp wiki or 4chan</h1>
    <p> The scp wiki and 4chan are very important to me when it comes to coding. One of the things I like about both of these sites is the fact that they are very old websites.</p>
    <p> Because the sites are old it means that they have lots of content and history from the people that contribute to the site.</p>
    <h2> The SCP wiki</h2>
    <p>The scp wiki has existed for around 14 years and through it's 14 years it has gained lots of popularity and notoritity on the the internet. The scp if wiki is full of fun and nostolgic articles that writers from across the world have created, but before that we also have to know how the scpverse even came to be and thats how 4chan comes in!</p>
    <h2> How 4Chan created the scp wiki!</h2>
    <p>4chan was an image board created in 2003, where users can go anonomous and post images. On 4chan there are different forums where people talk about what the forum is about. Also let me remind you about something, the scp wiki are filled with creepy objects and monsters that can do very cool things and the first scp was very creepy! On 4chan there was a forum about the paranormal, and this is where the scpverse started(the first scp was created by user moto42 based on the creepy satue called untitled 2004 by japanese artist Izumi Kato).</p>
    <h2> In conclusion</h2>
    <p>So in concluesion it's my goal to ceate a site more like the scp wiki than 4chan so not only I but other people from across the world can write on my site to create content on the internet for years to come!!!!!!</p>
